Things to discuss with Henrik when he gets back:

- Timings 		
	- is 300ms OK for the Monster image with the default settings?
	- should we try harder to improve it?
	- timings across different runs vary by as much as 30%

- DT and tracing
	- the new idea (follow normals while going up in the DT)
	- try to do tracing in parallel (using OpenMP)

- Luminance adjustment
	- delta L in Lab and Yxy space results in non-RGB colours (clipping?)
	- clipping of heights of CPs over a flat/textured image
