Main Points:
fix colour-luminance synchronisation
add window for shading profile
zooming
fix remaining issues with the surfaces
deal with junctions
brushing (later)

Henrik:
fix closed curve issue, with too many points
fix slope curve issue, make manifold mesh
fix bug at high curvature normals

Flora:
High priority:
add button for subdividing the origninal control points
split curves at an inserted junction, using 1/3-2/3 subdivision rule
delete all data
fix moving (move display curve using subvision before glPopName)
fix deleting
surface check boxes are unchecked by default
when curve is closed, change subivision scheme; should be able to change back (to end conditions)
add slope curve option to b spline 
fix colour issue (use all curves for distance transform)

Mid priority:
only show control points for the selected curve
zooming
change resolution
fix colour selection with an underlying image
toggle between image/blank image/result
add shape window (quadratics)

Low priority:
add cubics to shape window

pseudo code for splitting a curve at CP_i
define new end points at the limit point: 0.1667*CP_i-1 + 0.667*CP_i + 0.1667*CP_i+1
define second CP for each new curve: 0.33*CP_i-1+0.667*CP_i (same for the other point)
