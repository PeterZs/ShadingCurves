BUGS, low priority:
- colouring bug



Jiri:
- look at timings, optimise everything to get interactive shading
- sort out the Lab space problem (bug in OpenCV?)
- optionally add super sampling options to 3D GUI

?Flora:
- look at clipping at CP height level (currently done on pixels during shading)
