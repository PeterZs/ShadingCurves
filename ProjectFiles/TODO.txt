BUGS
- colouring bug
- add control point bug. steps: 1. click "Create". 2. add a control point. 3. delete it 4. add a new CP: ASSERT failure in QList<T>::operator[]: "index out of range"

Done (TODO for Henrik: verify these):
merge surfaces
- add slider for reducing number of subdivision steps for interactive purposes
- add cubics to shape window
- add shape window (quadratics)
- A check button (possibly with a thickness spinbox) which would control for each curve whether it will appear in black on the shaded image. 
There could also be global settings for all curves and the per-curve stuff above could override it. 

Note:
connect surface width (or extent) slider to control points (Flora: We have such a slider in the shape window. Is there a need to that with the slider as well?) HENRIK: NO!
