Main Points:
fix colour-luminance synchronisation
add window for shading profile
zooming
fix remaining issues with the surfaces
deal with junctions
brushing

other (bonuses):
weighted distance transform?

Henrik:
turn off brushing
make "backwards" subdivision
fix closed curve issue, with too many points
fix slope curve issue, make manifold mesh
fix bug at high curvature normals
fix bug when curve is narrow

Flora:
High priority:
add functionality to "Show curves"
fix bug when pressing S
when move: recompute all surfaces. Do not recompute surfaces when adding points, however, when finished (i.e. Enter is pressed), then recompute the surfaces.
add status bar
change green points to "super control points", change code structure
split curves at an inserted junction, using 1/3-2/3 subdivision rule
when curve is closed, change subivision scheme; should be able to change back (to end conditions)
add slope curve option to b spline

Mid priority:
update region colouring on open curve
zooming
change resolution
toggle between image/blank image/result
add shape window (quadratics)

Low priority:
add cubics to shape window
change button for subdivision into Jiri's approach. Keep green points at level 2; add subdivision level for blue points

pseudo code for splitting a curve at CP_i
define new end points at the limit point: 0.1667*CP_i-1 + 0.667*CP_i + 0.1667*CP_i+1
define second CP for each new curve: 0.33*CP_i-1+0.667*CP_i (same for the other point)
