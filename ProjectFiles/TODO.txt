Main Points:
add window for shading profile
deal with junctions

Henrik and Flora:
An edge control point should only appear once in the surface. fix this for junction and slope curves

Flora:
High priority:
add shape window (quadratics)
merge surfaces
connect surface width (or extent) slider to control points (Flora: We have such a slider in the shape window. Is there a need to that with the slider as well?)
when selecting colour: set the default value in the colour picker to the colour of the double-clicked pixel

BUGS:
- do not interpolate any control point when its a slope or uniform curve

Mid priority:
add slider for reducing number of subdivision steps for interactive purposes

Low priority:
add cubics to shape window
