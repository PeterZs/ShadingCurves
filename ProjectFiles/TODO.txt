Main Points:
add window for shading profile
zooming
deal with junctions

Issues:
Look into surface creations for curves with uniform subdivision

other (bonuses):
weighted distance transform?

Henrik:

Flora:
High priority:
split curves at an inserted junction, using 1/3-2/3 subdivision rule
add shape window (quadratics)

Mid priority:
update region colouring on open curve (solved?)
zooming
toggle between image/blank image/result

Low priority:
add cubics to shape window

pseudo code for splitting a curve at CP_i
define new end points at the limit point: 0.1667*CP_i-1 + 0.667*CP_i + 0.1667*CP_i+1
define second CP for each new curve: 0.33*CP_i-1+0.667*CP_i (same for the other point)
