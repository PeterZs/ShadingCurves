Main Points:
add window for shading profile
zooming
deal with junctions

Issues:
Look into surface creations for curves with uniform subdivision

other (bonuses):
weighted distance transform?

Henrik:

Flora:
High priority:
split curves at an inserted junction, using 1/3-2/3 subdivision rule
add shape window (quadratics)

Mid priority:
update region colouring on open curve
zooming
toggle between image/blank image/result

Low priority:
add cubics to shape window

Done:
add status bar
add functionality to "Show curves"
fix bug when pressing S
when move: recompute all surfaces. Do not recompute surfaces when adding points, however, when finished (i.e. Enter is pressed), then recompute the surfaces.
change blue points to "super control points", change code structure
add slope curve option to b spline
when curve is closed, change subivision scheme; should be able to change back (to end conditions)
change resolution

pseudo code for splitting a curve at CP_i
define new end points at the limit point: 0.1667*CP_i-1 + 0.667*CP_i + 0.1667*CP_i+1
define second CP for each new curve: 0.33*CP_i-1+0.667*CP_i (same for the other point)
