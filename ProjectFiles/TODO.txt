Main Points:
fix colour-luminance synchronisation
add window for shading profile
zooming
fix remaining issues with the surfaces
deal with junctions
brushing (later)

Henrik:
fix closed curve issue, with too many points
fix slope curve issue, make manifold mesh
fix bug at high curvature normals

Flora:
High priority:
split curves at an inserted junction, using 1/3-2/3 subdivision rule
when curve is closed, change subivision scheme; should be able to change back (to end conditions)
add slope curve option to b spline 

Mid priority:
zooming
change resolution
toggle between image/blank image/result
add shape window (quadratics)

Low priority:
add cubics to shape window

Done:
fix moving (move display curve using subvision before glPopName)
fix deleting
surface check boxes are unchecked by default
add button for subdividing the origninal control points
delete all data
save color mappings with curves
fix colour issue (use all curves for distance transform)
only show control points for the selected curve
fix colour selection with an underlying image

pseudo code for splitting a curve at CP_i
define new end points at the limit point: 0.1667*CP_i-1 + 0.667*CP_i + 0.1667*CP_i+1
define second CP for each new curve: 0.33*CP_i-1+0.667*CP_i (same for the other point)
